Before you get started here make sure you have completed the [tmrev-local-db](https://github.com/tmrev/tmrev-local-db)

## Tech Stack
- Typescript
- Express
- MongoDB


## Development Tools
- VS Code
- Nodejs
- Yarn

## Getting Started
1. clone the github repo `https://github.com/tmrev/tmrev-api.git`
2. create a `.env` file and a `cred.json` file in the root directory

you're `.env` file should look something like this:
```
PORT=8080

DB_HOST="mongodb://localhost:27017"

# firebase auth
PROJECT_ID="
PRIVATE_KEY=""

# the movie database
TMDB_API_KEY=""
```
you can find that information [here](https://github.com/tmrev/tmrev.io/wiki/Getting-Started-with-tmrev-io-(creationals))

your're `cred.json` file should look something like this:
```
{
    "type": "",
    "project_id": "",
    "private_key_id": "",
    "private_key": "",
    "client_email": "",
    "client_id": "",
    "auth_uri": "",
    "token_uri": "",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "",
    "client_x509_cert_url": ""
  }
  
```
this should be the same JSON file you downloaded from firebase
